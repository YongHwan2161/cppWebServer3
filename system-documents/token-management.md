# Token Management

## Testing

### Sequential Token Creation Test
The system provides a test to verify proper token creation through sentence creation:

#### Test Process
1. String Building
   - Starts with 2-character string ("AB")
   - Incrementally adds characters ("ABC", "ABCD", etc.)
   - Tests up to full alphabet sequence

2. Sentence Creation
   - Uses handle_create_sentence for each string
   - Automatically handles token creation and linking
   - Creates cycle structure for each sentence

3. Verification
   - Ensures each sentence creation succeeds
   - Verifies complete token creation process
   - Tests cycle formation functionality

#### Command Interface
```shell
test-sequential-token
```

#### Example Output
```
Testing sequential token creation...
Creating sentence for: AB
Successfully created sentence for AB
Creating sentence for: ABC
Successfully created sentence for ABC
Creating sentence for: ABCD
Successfully created sentence for ABCD
...
Sequential token creation tests completed. Failed tests: 0
```

#### Implementation Details
1. Sentence Creation
   - Uses handle_create_sentence function
   - Automatically handles token search and creation
   - Creates proper cycle structure

2. Token Management
   - Automatic token splitting and combination
   - Proper cycle formation
   - Efficient token reuse

3. Error Handling
   - Sentence creation failures
   - Invalid string handling
   - Resource management

#### Benefits
1. Integration Testing
   - Tests complete sentence creation flow
   - Verifies token management system
   - Validates cycle creation

2. Error Detection
   - Early failure identification
   - Clear error reporting
   - System stability verification

3. System Validation
   - End-to-end functionality testing
   - Memory management verification
   - Token reuse optimization

#### Notes
- Each sentence creation results in a cycle structure
- Tokens are automatically created and combined as needed
- System handles memory management automatically
- Failures are clearly reported and tracked
